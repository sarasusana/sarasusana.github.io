      <h3>Franklin was almost called Marthasville, and it used to be in North Carolina</h3></section>

              <section class="curiosities"><a href="https://williamsonsource.com/10-facts-about-franklin-you-might-not-know/"><figure id="poster"><img src="images/maury.jpg" alt="poster"><figcaption id="caption-tdh">Abram Maury, founder of Franklin</figcaption></figure></a></section>
          
          <section class=details><p>When the land that would become Williamson County and Franklin was officially ceded to the United States by the Cherokees and Chickasaws in 1785 and 1786, Fort Nashborough and a spattering of smaller fort-like settlements made up the bulk of the non-native population. The land, which was part of North Carolina, had been first settled in a bend on the western bank of the Cumberland River with the founding of Fort Nashborough in February, 1780.
          <br><br>
          Abram Maury had bought 640-acres of land from a Major Anthony Sharp in a bend of the Harpeth River, and he had the idea of erecting a town on it. (After the Revolutionary War, cash poor but land rich, many colonies paid off their debts owed in wages to soldiers with land grants.) Only one settler, Ewen Cameron, a 30-year old Scotsman from Virginia, currently lived on the land, in a log home on what is now Second Avenue South.
          <br><br>
          Maury (1766-1825) came to this area from Virginia in 1797. In 1798, he drew out a plan for a town named Marthasville, after his wife, on 109 of his acres. The plan can be seen above. Maury, who became a prosperous planter, surveyor and state senator, donated the lands for a public square, streets, and a Methodist Church.
          <br><br>
          However, Martha, perhaps less enthusiastic about the town’s prospects, demurred. As his second choice, Maury decided to dub the town Franklin, after Benjamin Franklin.
          <br><br>
          The plan he drew still, more or less, stands today. There were 16 square blocks, five streets each running north-south and east-west, a public square in the center, and 12 half-acre lots on a block.
          <br><br>
          The street names, also, were the same– except for the numbered avenues. They were East and West Margin Streets, Indigo Street and Cameron Street.
          <br><br>
          He began selling lots at $10 each. About a quarter of the 192 lots sold by 1800.
          <br><br>
          By 1806 he had helped build the historic courthouse still standing in the square today, as the seat of the county.
          <br><br>
          By 1813 the city would have nearly 1,500 residents and be growing quickly as a regional hub of commerce and agriculture.
